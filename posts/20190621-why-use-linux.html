			<p>Nowadays there is free and open source software for any program you might use on another operating system. <br>But why switch if you are comfortable with your current OS?</p>

			<p>We all know it, people don't like changing. So here are some good reasons (in my opinion) on why you should make the switch to a Linux distribution.</p>

			<h2>Open Source</h2>
			<p>The open source aspect of Linux is a very important one. The term "open source" means that the code is freely available to the public (the opposite of "proprietary software") and anybody
			can access it and modify it. Obviously the code is checked and scrutinized thoroughly before a push to the servers.<br>
			This involves that you'll be using an always updated, safe program, that doesn't steal your information.</p>

			<h2>Cost</h2>

			<p>This might not be something you care for, but some people do. Open source software is often free or available at a very low cost.
			For example, one of the most popular Linux distribution, <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, is available for free.
			</p>

			<h2>Customization</h2>
			<p>If you are a developer or even a computer enthusiast, you'll might want to customize the UI of your OS. With Linux distros this is easily
			accomplished by running commands on a terminal window. Of course there are online forums, guides and tutorials written by users for users in need.
			<br>This is not something to take easily: no other proprietary operating system will let you do this easily and without some major hacks to the system or "closed-source" programs
			written by other developers.</p>

			<h2>Less Viruses, More Security</h2>
			<p>Although Linux server distributions are very popular, we can't say the same about the desktop ones. This logically involves that hackers are more focused on
			making viruses for more popular operating systems, like Windows for example. </p>
			<p>
			According to the National Institute of Standars, which mantains the Technology National Vulnerability Database, in 2017 ~39.6% of malware were found on Windows operating systems,
			~12.4% on Linux Kernel distros and ~6.3% on Debian Linux.<a href="#ref-malware-stats"><sup >[1]</sup></a>
			</p>

			<h2>Gaming on Linux</h2>
			<p>If you are a gamer, you're probably thinking: <i>"I'd like to switch to Linux but all my favorite games are only available on Windows!"</i>
			<br>People may answer to this problem with the program <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> but I won't and here's why:<br>
			I also play games. I want all my games organized in one place and I want them to perform natively, not through a program that acs as a compatibility layer like Wine.<a href="#ref-wine"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
			<p>Don't get me wrong, Wine is a wonderful program that does the job but for some reason, Windows seemed to take care of running games better.<br>
			My solution was to install Windows on a separate partition of the hard drive, so that I can boot Windows only when I want to play games. For any other task, I use Linux.
			</p>
			<p>This can apply also to other programs and not just games. I'm thinking of Adobe Photoshop for example, or another "pro" program only available on proprietary operating systems. </p>

			<p><b><a target="blank" href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Click here</a> to go to the Ubuntu download page!</b> LTS versions grant "Long Term Support" and updates up to 5 years. </p>

			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>Using Linux is a win-win: not only your system is more protected <i>(all for free)</i> but is also more usable and easily customizable. Don't like something, change it!<br>
			If you need to use a program that's on a proprietary OS at all costs, make a partition on your hard drive and install Linux. You can boot into the other OS when you have to
			use that program and use Linux every other time.</p>
